# VRC-PiShock

Trigger shock based on parameters sent from VRChat

- Requires Node.js plus dependencies that you can install by running "install_dependencies.bat"
- Add the needed info to the config.json as is described within the file itself.
- The script accepts a config file as a command-line variable so you can run it with separate configs. Example: "node index.js config2.json".
- The config will get auto reloaded if you update it while the script is running.
- Start the script by tunning "start.bat". VRChat should autodetect the application and start seinding parameters to it.
